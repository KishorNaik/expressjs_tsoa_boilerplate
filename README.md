## üìå Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, we strongly recommend familiarizing yourself with a few key concepts and libraries that form the foundation of this boilerplate. This will help you write clean, maintainable code and make the most of the built-in tooling.

### üß± Modular Approach

This boilerplate is built with modularity in mind. Each feature or endpoint is designed to live in its own self-contained slice making it easier to reason about, test, and maintain. You are free to organize your code however you like, but we strongly encourage a modular mindset to keep things clean and scalable.

### üß≠ Vertical Slice Architecture Design

This project encourages but doesn‚Äôt enforce. A vertical slice architecture guided by SOLID principles. That means structuring your code by feature (not by layer), keeping responsibilities isolated, and designing endpoints that are easy to reason about and maintain.

If you are already familiar with SOLID, great. You will feel right at home. If not, don‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôll pick up the patterns naturally as you explore the codebase and supporting utilities.

### üìö Core Packages (Bundled via @kishornaik/utils)

To support this architecture, the boilerplate integrates several powerful open-source libraries ‚Äî all bundled into the `@kishornaik/utils` package (https://github.com/KishorNaik/utils). This utility library is the backbone of the boilerplate, offering batteries-included support for predefined models, validation, error handling, messaging workflows, helper functions, and more. Before jumping into the code, we recommend exploring the following repositories to understand their concepts and usage:

Here‚Äôs a quick overview of what‚Äôs inside:

| Swagger Docs | http://localhost:3000/api-docs | Interactive API documentation generated via TSOA and OpenAPI.‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Swagger is only available in the development environment for security reasons. |

These endpoints are part of the boilerplate‚Äôs built-in observability and documentation layer ‚Äî no extra setup required.

### üê≥ Optional: Devcontainer Setup

If you're using VS Code with Dev Containers, this project `.devcontainer` includes a configuration for consistent local development. Just open the folder in VS Code and choose `Reopen in Container` when prompted.
You can visit [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) to learn more about Dev Containers.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Devcontainer Runtime Note

Before running npm run build or npm run dev inside the container, make sure your Node.js and npm versions are properly installed and accessible:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

If you encounter an error like this:

```bash
$ npm --version
node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1251
  throw err;
  ^

Error: Cannot find module '/root/.vscode-server/data/User/workspaceStorage/ecbd587727c66e87727639745fae6f85/ms-vscode.js-debug/bootloader.js'

### üêã Docker Setup

This boilerplate includes Docker support for both development and production environments. Instead of using a single `docker-compose.yml`, the project provides separate Dockerfiles for each service including the API and background workers to give you more control and flexibility

If you prefer, you can create your own `docker-compose.yml` file and configure it as per your deployment needs.

üì¶ Available Dockerfiles

| Service  | Development                                                                                                         | Production                                                                                                            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API      | [Dockerfile.api.dev](https://github.com/KishorNaik/expressjs_tsoa_boilerplate/blob/main/Dockerfile.api.dev)         | [Dockerfile.api.prod](https://github.com/KishorNaik/expressjs_tsoa_boilerplate/blob/main/Dockerfile.api.prod)         |
| BullMq   | [Dockerfile.bullMq.dev](https://github.com/KishorNaik/expressjs_tsoa_boilerplate/blob/main/Dockerfile.bullMq.dev)   | [Dockerfile.bullMq.prod](https://github.com/KishorNaik/expressjs_tsoa_boilerplate/blob/main/Dockerfile.bullMq.prod)   |
| Cron Job | [Dockerfile.cronJob.dev](https://github.com/KishorNaik/expressjs_tsoa_boilerplate/blob/main/Dockerfile.cronJob.dev) | [Dockerfile.cronJob.prod](https://github.com/KishorNaik/expressjs_tsoa_boilerplate/blob/main/Dockerfile.cronJob.prod) |

üìù Notes:

- BullMQ, Apache Kafka, RabbitMq and CronJob workers are script-based and do not expose any ports. They run as background processes.
- The API and each worker are intended to be deployed as separate services for scalability and isolation.
- Dockerfiles for Kafka worker and RabbitMQ worker are not included, but you can refer to the BullMQ worker Dockerfile as a template for creating them.

#### üöÄ Build & Run Commands

### üîÅ PM2 Process Manager

This boilerplate uses PM2 as the default process manager for running both the API and background workers in containerized environments. PM2 ensures reliable process management, automatic restarts, and clean logging especially useful in production.

#### üìÇ Configuration

PM2 setup is already defined in the project. If you‚Äôd like to customize process names, environment variables, or script paths, you can modify the config file here:
üëâ https://github.com/KishorNaik/expressjs_tsoa_boilerplate/blob/main/ecosystem.config.js

#### üêã Docker Integration

All Dockerfiles ‚Äî for the API and workers ‚Äî are configured to use PM2 runtime internally. This means:

- Each service runs as a managed PM2 process inside its container
- Logs and lifecycle events are handled automatically
- You don‚Äôt need to manually invoke pm2 start ‚Äî it‚Äôs baked into the Docker entrypoint

#### üñ•Ô∏è Local Development Note

For local development, the API and workers run using standard npm scripts. PM2 is not used by default. However, if you prefer to run services locally using PM2, we‚Äôve provided dedicated scripts for that in the `Available Scripts` section of the documentation.

### üìú Available Scripts

This boilerplate comes with a rich set of npm scripts to streamline development, testing, debugging, and deployment. Whether you're running locally with nodemon or managing services with PM2, these commands are designed to support both development and production workflows.
