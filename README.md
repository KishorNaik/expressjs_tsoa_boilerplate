This isn‚Äôt just a code dump. It‚Äôs a thoughtfully crafted starting point for teams who care about velocity, safety, and developer experience.

## üìå Prerequisites
Before diving into the code, we strongly recommend familiarizing yourself with a few key concepts and libraries that form the foundation of this boilerplate. This will help you write clean, maintainable code and make the most of the built-in tooling.

### üß± Modular Approach
This boilerplate is built with modularity in mind. Each feature or endpoint is designed to live in its own self-contained slice making it easier to reason about, test, and maintain. You are free to organize your code however you like, but we strongly encourage a modular mindset to keep things clean and scalable.

### üß≠ Vertical Slice Architecture Design
This project encourages but doesn‚Äôt enforce. A vertical slice architecture guided by SOLID principles. That means structuring your code by feature (not by layer), keeping responsibilities isolated, and designing endpoints that are easy to reason about and maintain.

If you are already familiar with SOLID, great. You will feel right at home. If not, don‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôll pick up the patterns naturally as you explore the codebase and supporting utilities.

### üìö Core Packages (Bundled via @kishornaik/utils)
To support this architecture, the boilerplate integrates several powerful open-source libraries ‚Äî all bundled into the `@kishornaik/utils` package (https://github.com/KishorNaik/utils). This utility library is the backbone of the boilerplate, offering batteries-included support for predefined models, validation, error handling, messaging workflows, helper functions, and more. Before jumping into the code, we recommend exploring the following repositories to understand their concepts and usage:

Here‚Äôs a quick overview of what‚Äôs inside:

| Packages      | Summary |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [tsoa](https://github.com/lukeautry/tsoa)      | Type-safe routing and OpenAPI generation for Express.js using TypeScript decorators.       |
| [mediatr-ts](https://github.com/m4ss1m0g/mediatr-ts)   | Implements the mediator pattern for decoupled request handling using commands, queries, and handlers. (CQRS Pattern)       |
| [neverthrow](https://github.com/supermacro/neverthrow)   | Functional error-handling with typed `Result` objects ‚Äî safer than throwing exceptions.|
| [typedi](https://github.com/typestack/typedi)   | Dependency injection container for TypeScript, enabling clean service registration and resolution.        |
| [linq](https://github.com/mihaifm/linq)   | LINQ-style query library for expressive data transformations in JavaScript/TypeScript.        |
| [typeORM](https://typeorm.io/)   | Feature-rich ORM for TypeScript with support for decorators, migrations, and multiple databases.        |
| [class-validator](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator)   | Declarative validation for TypeScript classes using decorators ‚Äî perfect for DTOs and request schemas.        |

All of these are pre-integrated and exposed via `@kishornaik/utils` npm package, so you don‚Äôt need to install or wire them manually. Just import and go.
This package is fully open source and designed to empower developers with clean, reusable patterns; whether you're building a small service or scaling a platform.

- Database (PostgreSQL)
- Redis
- RabbitMQ
- Kafka
- Pusher

### üì¶ Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js (v22) and npm installed. Then run:
```bash
npm install
```

### üß™ Verify Setup
```bash
npm run build
npm run dev
```
Once the server starts, you‚Äôll have access to several built-in endpoints for monitoring and documentation:
- Health Check ‚Üí [http://localhost:3000/health]
Returns a simple status response to confirm the server is alive.
- API Info ‚Üí [http://localhost:3000/info]
Provides metadata about the API ‚Äî version, environment, and other useful details.
- Metrics ‚Üí [http://localhost:3000/metrics]
Shows metrics information for the current application.
- Swagger Docs ‚Üí [http://localhost:3000/api-docs]
  - Interactive API documentation generated via TSOA and OpenAPI.
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Swagger is only available in the development environment for security reasons.

These endpoints are part of the boilerplate‚Äôs built-in observability and documentation layer ‚Äî no extra setup required.

### üê≥ Optional: Devcontainer Setup
If you're using VS Code with Dev Containers, this project `.devcontainer` includes a  configuration for consistent local development. Just open the folder in VS Code and choose `Reopen in Container` when prompted.
You can visit [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) to learn more about Dev Containers.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Devcontainer Runtime Note

### üêã Docker Setup
This boilerplate includes Docker support for both development and production environments. Instead of using a single docker-compose.yml, the project provides separate Dockerfiles for each service ‚Äî including the API and background workers.
üì¶ Available Dockerfiles
|  |  |  |
|  | Dockerfile.api.dev | Dockerfile.api.prod |
|  | Dockerfile.bullMq.dev | Dockerfile.bullMq.prod |
|  | Dockerfile.cronJob.dev | Dockerfile.cronJob.prod |


üìù Note: BullMQ and CronJob workers are script-based and do not expose any ports. They run as background processes.


üöÄ Build & Run Commands
üîß API Server
Development:
docker build -f Dockerfile.api.dev -t api-dev .
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env api-dev

docker build -f Dockerfile.cronJob.prod -t cronjob-prod .
docker run --env-file .env cronjob-prod



Let me know when you're ready to move on to the Project Structure section ‚Äî we can walk developers through the folder layout and how it supports vertical slice architecture.

### üêã Docker Setup
This boilerplate includes Docker support for both development and production environments. Instead of using a single `docker-compose.yml`, the project provides separate Dockerfiles for each service including the API and background workers to give you more control and flexibility

If you prefer, you can create your own `docker-compose.yml` file and configure it as per your deployment needs.

üì¶ Available Dockerfiles

| Service     | Development | Production |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| API      | [Dockerfile.api.dev](https://github.com/KishorNaik/expressjs_tsoa_boilerplate/blob/main/Dockerfile.api.dev)       | [Dockerfile.api.prod](https://github.com/KishorNaik/expressjs_tsoa_boilerplate/blob/main/Dockerfile.api.prod)
| BullMq   | [Dockerfile.bullMq.dev](https://github.com/KishorNaik/expressjs_tsoa_boilerplate/blob/main/Dockerfile.bullMq.dev)        | [Dockerfile.bullMq.prod](https://github.com/KishorNaik/expressjs_tsoa_boilerplate/blob/main/Dockerfile.bullMq.prod) |
| Cron Job   | [Dockerfile.cronJob.dev](https://github.com/KishorNaik/expressjs_tsoa_boilerplate/blob/main/Dockerfile.cronJob.dev)        | [Dockerfile.cronJob.prod](https://github.com/KishorNaik/expressjs_tsoa_boilerplate/blob/main/Dockerfile.cronJob.prod) |

üìù Notes:
- BullMQ and CronJob workers are script-based and do not expose any ports. They run as background processes.
- The API and each worker are intended to be deployed as separate services for scalability and isolation.
- Dockerfiles for Kafka and RabbitMQ are not included, but you can refer to the BullMQ Dockerfile as a template for creating them.
